# 3 Million Men: Serial Based Solution
This is a serial-based solution to the 3 million men problem, utilising Hardy's algorithm.

You can read more about the problem [here](https://www.quora.com/How-to-sort-a-million-numbers-in-log-n-time-using-Norman-Hardy-solution).

The original purpose of such an algorithm was for sorting a list with limited information about the original order with old technology such as magnetic tapes. These could only be read in serial, hence a serial-based solution.
